Game Proposal:

We are creating a top-down view shooter game. There will be a controllable avatar who has health, a gun, and ammo. The player will be see his health and ammunitions bar, which determines how much health/ ammo he has. If the player’s health hits 0, the game will end. However, the player can regain a percentage of ammo and health by picking up items dropped by eliminated enemies. The avatar will be controlled using the keyboard arrows, and the player aims using the mouse, and left-clicks to shoot. The avatar is placed in a room with enemies, who will shoot at the player. The player will lose health if he is hit by enemy projectiles or if he touches the enemies. He must evade the bullets and shoot at the enemies to kill them. The first room that the avatar is placed in is programmed such that the player will easily learn the rules of the game.

Once all enemies in the room are destroyed, the player has the choice to open one of three doors. This choice appears in the form of a pop-up window - (Choose Door A, B or C). Regardless of which door the player opens, a random number of enemies, (there will be a specific range) will spawn and begin attacking the player. There will be an algorithm, such that if you have more enemies, their health/strength is lower, but if there are fewer enemies, their health/strength is higher. The algorithm will accept an integer counter parameter so that as more and more doors are opened, the level of the game increases and new stronger enemies spawn. When the counter reaches a certain number, the room may contain mines that damage the player when stepped on, thus increasing the level of difficulty for the player and adding an element of surprise. Like the first room, there will be a “mine room” tutorial for the player to understand the new element of the game. There is no way to “beat” the game - the player simply tries to get the highest score by clearing as many rooms as possible before dying.
